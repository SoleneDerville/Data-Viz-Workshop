# Data-Viz-Workshop
Data visualization in R and beyond: tips and tricks to publish and communicate your science

Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data. A great variety of tools and approaches are available to produce figures adapted to your audience, support medium, message or type of data. In this workshop we will cover the basic sets of rules to improve figure design for different purposes, from scientific publication to general public outreach. The R programming software (www.r-project.org) will be used in combination with Canva (www.canva.com) to produce visuals from ecological data of various types. The workshop will specifically provide insights and tips to enhance figure aesthetic, use different fonts and color palettes, combine multiple types of information and data in complex figures,  produce quality maps, leverage the ggplot2 package extensions, deal with figure formatting for scientific publication and produce graphical abstracts. The general objective is to help you make impactful scientific communication!
